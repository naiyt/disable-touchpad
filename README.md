Disable Touchpad
===============

Written by Nate Collings

Just a small script I threw together that allows you to quickly disable the touchpad on a laptop from the command line. I was getting annoyed that Ubuntu doesn't have the option to automatically disable the touchpad when a mouse is plugged in. Much rage ensued as the touchpad on my laptop is awfully close to my hands.

Works on my Acer Aspire 5560-7414 on Ubuntu 12.04, but your mileage may vary. I haven't tested it with anything else.
